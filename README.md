## Project Overview
**MusicMixes** is a machine learning project focused on analyzing and enhancing music preferences through intelligent recommendations and data-driven insights. Our goal is to explore the relationship between musical attributes and user preferences to create personalized, dynamic playlists tailored to individual tastes.
The project leverages machine learning models to predict user preferences and suggest music mixes that align with emotional or situational contexts.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering from Spotify's API
- Classification models to predict song likability
- Recommendation engine based on learned user preferences
- Visualization of musical trends and feature importances
